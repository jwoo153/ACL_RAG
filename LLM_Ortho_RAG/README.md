## Notes
The agentic architecture has high variability with the nodes, flow, and custom tools. The compatability may vary depending on which models you look to evaluate. Additionally, many of these files require API keys and/or separate accounts, some of which must be paid for separately. Download the aclcpg separately, and instantiate your own json files.
