Purpose: Publicly available Large Language Models draw data from the unregulated Internet and consequently output variably accurate responses. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the value of custom methods, namely Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic Augmentation, over standard LLMs in delivering accurate information using anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury as a use case.
